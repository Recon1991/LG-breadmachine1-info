[HOWTOADD INGREDIENTS

[ADDING INGREDIENTS INTO THE BREAD PAN
1. Me ered pan (F) by lifting the handle, turning counterclockwise and

lifting out. Place bread pan (F) on a clean, dry, level work surface,
CAUTION: itisimportant thatthe pan is filled with ingredients outside of the machin
avoid spilling ingredients onto the heating elements creating a Potential fire hazard,
2. STRICTLY FOLLOW THE RECIPES provided in latter pages of this user manual forthe
measurements, the amounts, and the adding sequences of the ingredients for each
Cooking program. Eggs, butter, and milk should be used at room temperature
because cold ingredients will de-activate the yeast.
USE ONLY THE MEASURING CUP AND THE MEASURING SPOONS PROVIDED. For
example, 1 cup of water equals one full measuring cup (not 3% cup) of water; 1 Tasp
of sugar means one full table spoon (the big measuring spoon) of sugar; 1 tsp of salt
means one full teaspoon (the small measuring spoon) of salt.
With wet ingredients, after filling the measuring cup, place it on a flat surface and
view it at eye level to make sure the amount of liquid is exact. With dry ingredients,
always “level off” the measurement with the back of a knife or a spatula to make
sure the measurement is exact. A helpful tip is to never use the measurement cup to
scoop the ingredients (for example, flour). By scooping, you could add up to one
tablespoon of extra ingredients. Fill the measuring cup with a spoon before leveling

off.
